A **standard page** is the most common type of page that you will create with Grav. By default a page is considered a standard page unless you tell Grav otherwise.


#High Definiton Mapping


##Motivation
Autonomous vehicles will require many system redundancies to deal with unforeseen circumstances. A High Definition Map is required for precise localization of the vehicle, relative to road boundaries and intersections, under all conditions.

While other sensors such as radar and LiDAR may provide redundancy for object detection â€“ the camera is the only real-time sensor for driving path geometry and other static scene semantics (such as traffic signs, on-road markings, etc.). Therefore, for path sensing and foresight purposes, only a highly accurate map can serve as the source of redundancy. In order for the map to be a reliable source of redundancy, it must be updated with an ultra-high refresh rate to secure its low Time to Reflect Reality (TTRR) qualities.

To address the challenge of creating High Definition Map, we are proposing to develope and setup the technology roadmap to create High Definiton Maps. This will build the solid foundation to explore the future possibilities to explore the option of building and proliferation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) suited for Indian road and traffic conditions. This when coupled with harnessing the power of the crowd will provide High Definition Map to be built and maintain in near-real-time an accurate map of the environment. The solution possiblly be comprised of three layers: harvesting agents (any camera-equipped vehicle), map aggregating server (cloud), and map-consuming agents (autonomous vehicle).
In the given project named Gaze and Maze, we are equipped to provide the roadmap to build the required infrastructure and know-how for the harvesting agents (camera equipped vehicle) to create the High Definition Map.
